# Location-Monitoring-System-for-KLETECH-Buses
ABSTRACT:

The public transportation system requires effective tracking and monitoring of bus locations for efficient operations and improved passenger experience. Hence, the tracking and monitoring of bus locations is crucial. In this work, we propose a system that automates the recording of GPS-based locations for KLETECH buses using IoT devices and a web/mobile application. Each bus will be equipped with an IoT device, such as an ESP32 microcontroller with a A7672x evaluation board with GNSS, which will periodically send the busâ€™s GPS coordinates to the Cloud platform for storage and analysis. A web/mobile application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for accessing the recorded bus location data, generating reports, and setting up alerts. The proposed system will leverage the capabilities of firebase, a cloud-based IoT analytics platform, to store and analyze the GPS data. Firebase APIs and libraries are used to integrate the IoT devices with the platform, enabling seamless data transmission and storage. The secure authentication mechanisms are implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the system. The monitoring mechanisms, such as logging and alerting, will be in place to ensure system reliability and performance. The proposed system will also provide real-time visibility of bus locations, enabling KLETECH to make data-driven decisions for improved operational efficiency and enhanced passenger experience.
